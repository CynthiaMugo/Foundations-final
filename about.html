            unforgettable characters, and late-night chapter binges.

            tribe here. So grab a cup of tea (or coffee—we don’t judge), crack open a book, and join us on this literary adventure.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Founders</h2>
        <p id="par">Fiction Addicts was brought to life in 2022 by three passionate book lovers who couldn't resist the pull of a good story and a warm cup 
            of coffee. Meet Peter Maina, Ariel Omondi, and Zamani Wekezo—the dynamic trio who started this community to bring fiction lovers 
            together and spark endless conversations.</p>

            <p>Ariel Omondi has a soft spot for romance novels that tug at the heartstrings. She believes in the power of love stories to heal 
                and inspire, and can often be found daydreaming about the perfect book boyfriend </p>

            <p><strong>Peter Maina</strong>  is a mystery aficionado with an eye for thrilling plots and unpredictable twists. He’s the kind of reader who loves 
                to be on the edge of their seat, and he’s always up for a good discussion about those “whodunit” moments.</p>

            <p><strong>Zamani Wekezo</strong> is our go-to for deep dives into character development and intricate narratives. He enjoys a good romance as much as 
                the next person but can easily get lost in the layers of suspense and plot-building.</p>
        </div>
        <p id="par">Together, they’ve created Fiction Addicts as a space where readers can escape reality, dive into books, and connect over their 
            shared love for mystery, romance, and beyond. They are always open to suggestions from members, love planning exciting community
             meetups, and most importantly, they never say no to a good book discussion over a hot cup of coffee. </p>
